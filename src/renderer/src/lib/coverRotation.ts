// Which suggested cover a song is currently showing, for the "rotate suggested
// covers" setting (see coverSuggestions.ts for the search that produces the
// candidates, and the store's rotateSuggestedCovers for the toggle).
//
// Like songPrefs.ts, this module holds only data and synchronous accessors and
// deliberately imports nothing but the storage helper: juicewrldApi's
// songToTrack reads it on every song → Track conversion, so importing the API
// layer here would make it a cycle. The async half lives in
// coverSuggestions.ts, which may import freely.
//
// Only the *chosen URL* is persisted, never a candidate index: the candidate
// list comes from a file search that changes as files are added, so an index
// would silently point at a different cover later. Resolving position by
// looking the URL up in the current list degrades gracefully instead.
//
// Nothing here ever writes songPrefs.cover_url — a rotated cover is a display
// choice, not a user override. Writing one would defeat the "user hasn't set a
// cover" condition that gates rotation, and sync junk up to the profile.

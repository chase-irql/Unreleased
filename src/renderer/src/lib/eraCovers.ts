// Per-era cover overrides. JWA shows one shared placeholder cover across every
// unreleased song in an era, so instead of personalizing covers one song at a
// time, a user can swap that placeholder for a cover of their own choosing and
// have it apply to every unreleased song in the era at once.
//
// Like coverRotation.ts, this module holds only data and synchronous
// accessors and deliberately imports nothing but the storage helper —
// juicewrldApi's songToTrack reads it on every song → Track conversion, so
// importing the API layer here would make it a cycle.
//
// The "unreleased only" and "personal cover wins" rules aren't enforced here —
// they're gated at the call sites (songToTrack, liteSongToTrack,
// applyPrefToTrack), same as coverRotation's rotated suggestions.

// Per-user, per-song overrides for API songs: a personal display name, a
// personal cover picked from the API's storage, a preferred version to play
// within the song's version group, and a play counter.
//
// This module holds only the data and its synchronous accessors, and
// deliberately imports nothing: juicewrldApi's songToTrack reads it on every
// song → Track conversion, so anything imported here would become a circular
// dependency of the API layer. The pieces live elsewhere:
//   - network calls          → preferencesApi.ts
//   - writes + React state   → the Zustand store (`songPrefs`)
//   - playback resolution    → queueSlice's version swap
//   - cover URL resolution   → juicewrldApi's resolvePrefCoverUrl
//
// The store owns every write and mirrors its map in here via setSongPrefsCache
// so non-React callers always resolve against the current overrides.

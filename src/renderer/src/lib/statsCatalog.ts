// Song metadata resolution for the Wrapped page (components/StatsView).
//
// A song-preference row is just {song id, playcount} — no title, no length, no
// era — so the page has to resolve every played id to a song before it can
// rank anything. Doing that one id at a time meant hundreds of requests on
// open, and worse, they didn't stick: apiCache holds ~300 entries for the
// entire app, so a few hundred played songs evict each other (and everything
// else) and the next visit refetches the lot.
//
// So this mirrors lib/heardle's pool cache instead: page the catalogue in bulk,
// slim each row down to the fields the page actually uses, and keep that in
// localStorage for a day. ~25 requests once, then none. Deliberately NOT routed
// through apiFetch for the same reason heardle isn't — a page of full song
// objects is ~0.5MB, and caching those raw would blow the offline cache out.

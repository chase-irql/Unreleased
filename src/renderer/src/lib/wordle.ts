//
// Same shape as Heardle and deliberately built on top of it: the catalogue
// pools, the title normalising and the whole-pool search are lib/heardle's, so
// the two games always agree on what a song is called and which songs exist.
// Everything is client-side for the same reason Heardle's local path is —
// there's no puzzle endpoint — so the daily title is *derived* from the date
// and every client that loads the same catalogue picks the same answer.
//
// The twist over classic Wordle: the answer isn't a five-letter word, it's a
// whole song title, and a guess has to be another real title of exactly the
// same letter count. The length is therefore a clue in itself, and the guess
// list is the catalogue rather than a dictionary — which is what makes it a
// *song title* game instead of a word game with a music skin.

// calls live in reportsApi.ts and the queue/flush logic in the store.

// Like lib/songPrefs, this module imports nothing so it can be pulled in
// anywhere without risking an import cycle. It runs local-first: a report is
// written to a persisted outbox immediately and delivered when the endpoints
// exist and the network is reachable (see reportsApiEnabled), so a user who
// reports something today doesn't lose it just because the backend isn't live.

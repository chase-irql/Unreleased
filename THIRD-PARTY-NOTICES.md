# Third-Party Notices

**unreleased** is distributed with third-party software. The project's own
source code is licensed under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The
components listed below retain their own licenses, which are reproduced or
linked here to satisfy their attribution and distribution terms.

If you distribute a build of this application, keep this file (and the
FFmpeg notice in particular) with the distribution.

## FFmpeg — GNU General Public License v3.0 (IMPORTANT)

Desktop builds bundle a prebuilt **FFmpeg** binary (via the
[`ffmpeg-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) npm package) to
power local audio format conversion. This FFmpeg binary is licensed under the
**GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later)**.

The application invokes FFmpeg as a **separate command-line subprocess**. Under
the GPL this is treated as mere aggregation, so bundling FFmpeg does **not**
place this project's own MIT-licensed source code under the GPL. The FFmpeg
binary, however, remains governed by the GPL, and the following obligations
apply to any distribution that includes it:

- **License text.** FFmpeg is Copyright (c) the FFmpeg developers and
  contributors. The full text of the GNU General Public License v3.0 is
  available at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt> and is included with
  the FFmpeg distribution.
- **Written offer of source.** The complete corresponding source code for the
  bundled FFmpeg build is available from the FFmpeg project at
  <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html> and <https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git>.
  Anyone who receives this application may obtain that source there, or by
  contacting us through the channels in the [README](README.md) / project
  Discord to request a copy of the source corresponding to the bundled version.
- **No warranty.** FFmpeg is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; see the GPL for
  details.

FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard, originator of the FFmpeg project.

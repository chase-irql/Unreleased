---

## [1.20.8] — 2026-08-11

- **New** **Follow a shared playlist** — a live pointer to the owner's playlist that always shows their current tracks, no account needed, alongside the existing one-time "save a copy" import
- **New** **Rotate suggested covers** — songs without a custom cover cycle through different covers found in the API's files each time they play
- **New** Text file viewer — view `.txt`/`.lrc` and other plain-text files right in the Files tab
- **New** Custom colors for the active/inactive synced-lyrics lines, an adjustable "blur inactive lyrics" amount, and smaller rendering for ad-libs
- **Improve** Playback that stalls or fails to load now automatically retries (with a cap) instead of silently getting stuck; an API outage stops the queue instead of racing through every track
- **Fix** Background playback with audio effects enabled could get killed by the OS on mobile (Android doze/screen-off) — effects now only attach once actually turned on

---

## [1.20.7] — 2026-08-10

- **New** Copy or save a song's cover image directly from Song Info
- **Fix** Heardle's daily puzzle now uses the server's date instead of your device's, so players in some timezones were no longer wrongly rejected

---

## [1.20.6] — 2026-08-09

- **New** In-app and global keyboard shortcuts can now be rebound independently — a shortcut can be in-app-only, global (OS-wide), or both
- **New** *(Desktop)* "Media key overlay" toggle — show or hide the Windows volume/media flyout when pressing media keys
- **New** Right-click your profile in the sidebar to copy your auth token
- **Improve** *(Desktop)* The app now checks for updates periodically while running, not just at startup

---

## [1.20.5] — 2026-08-09

- **New** *(Desktop)* Local file management in the Files tab — rename, create new files/folders, and delete to the OS trash

---

## [1.20.0] — 2026-08-08

- **New** **Manager** role — a step below Admin, with review powers over proposals and staff, short of full admin access
- **New** News page's "Feed" tab shows a live stream of recent Tracker edits and comp-file changes as they happen
- **Fix** Discord login (and shared-playlist links) could land on a blank white page due to a broken asset path on nested URLs
- **Fix** 999 FM voting and song suggestions now show an accurate error when they don't actually register, instead of silently looking successful
- **Fix** Song suggestions for 999 FM now search the DJ's actual playable library, so a proposal always matches a real track instead of silently failing
- **Fix** 999 FM listener identity is now stable across reloads and multiple tabs, so vote thresholds aren't skewed by phantom duplicate listeners

---

## [1.19.3] — 2026-08-07

- **New** Heardle gained a real-time **1v1 mode** — match live against another player
- **New** Heardle **leaderboards** (Today / Streaks / 1v1) are now live

---

## [1.19.2] — 2026-08-04

- **New** Contributors (and admins) can propose a file replacement or deletion right from the Files browser's context menu, not just the dedicated Contributor page

---

## [1.18.7] — 2026-08-02

- **New** *(Desktop)* macOS builds — signed DMGs for Intel and Apple Silicon are now built and published alongside the Windows and Linux releases
- **New** *(Desktop)* Import and export local playlists as M3U — importing matches each path to your scanned library and reports which tracks weren't found

- **Improve** Local-file context menu's file actions (convert, copy, move, delete) tidied into their own submenu

---
